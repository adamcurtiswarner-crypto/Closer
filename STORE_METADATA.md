Daily prompts for couples

**Full Description:**
Closer helps couples stay connected through daily conversation prompts grounded in relationship research.

Each day, you and your partner receive the same prompt — a thoughtful question designed to spark real conversation. Respond at your own pace, then read each other's answers.

Features:
- Research-backed daily prompts (Gottman-inspired)
- Streaks to build a daily connection habit
- Weekly recaps of your shared moments
- Save your favorite conversations as memories
- Smart prompt scheduling (daily, weekdays, or weekends)
- Tone calibration adapts prompts to your relationship needs
- End-to-end encrypted responses
- Push notifications to stay in sync

Closer is not therapy or crisis support. If you feel unsafe in your relationship, please seek help.
